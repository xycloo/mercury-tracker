## Mercury ALPHA

The alpha release of Mercury is ready! The alpha release consists of the most barebones implementation of Mercury: the interoperation among the ingestor, the PostgreSQL database, and the backend.

All these three components are experimental in the alpha release and still need to be extended, optimized, and thoroughly tested. This is just the starting point.

More info about the ALPHA release, how request access, and how to use it can be found on [`ALPHA.md`](./ALPHA.md).
